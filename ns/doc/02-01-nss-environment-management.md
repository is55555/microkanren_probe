## ðŸ“˜ Subsystem: Environment Management

### Purpose

This component tracks the **mapping between original and mangled symbol names** across namespace scopes. It simulates lexical scope using a stack of environments, where each environment frame is an association list mapping unqualified names to their mangled equivalents.

---

### Main Concepts

#### âœ… `scoped-env`
A stack of frames, each frame being an alist like:
```scheme
((a . geometry::a)
 (b . geometry::short::b))
```

#### âœ… Inheritance
When a new scope is pushed, it copies the current top environment:
```scheme
(push-scope!) â†’ (cons (copy of top frame) scoped-env)
```
This ensures that inner forms still resolve outer bindings â€” crucial for inlined or nested namespace forms.

---

### Public Functions

#### `push-scope!`
Pushes a new frame on top of the environment stack.  
Inherits all previous bindings.

#### `pop-scope!`
Removes the top frame.  
Should match each `push-scope!` one-to-one.

#### `define-symbol! name mangled`
Adds a `(name . mangled)` entry to the top environment frame.

#### `lookup-symbol sym`
Looks up a symbol name from the top of the stack downward.
If no match is found, returns the original symbol (assumed global).

---

### ðŸ§ª Expected Behavior

#### Example 1 â€” Nested Scope with Inheritance
```scheme
(push-scope!) ; env = ()
(define-symbol! 'a 'ns::a)
(push-scope!) ; inherits a
(lookup-symbol 'a) â‡’ ns::a
(pop-scope!)
(pop-scope!)
```

#### Example 2 â€” Shadowing
```scheme
(push-scope!)
(define-symbol! 'x 'outer::x)
(push-scope!)
(define-symbol! 'x 'inner::x)
(lookup-symbol 'x) â‡’ inner::x
(pop-scope!)
(lookup-symbol 'x) â‡’ outer::x
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Suggested Tests

- [ ] Lookup from empty env returns symbol unchanged
- [ ] Lookup after `define-symbol!` returns mangled name
- [ ] Pushed frame inherits previous bindings
- [ ] Nested shadowing resolves to innermost
- [ ] Pop restores previous scope

[TODO: draft a test suite for this next]
[NEXT: symbol mangling]
